	<h1>What We Do</h1>


	<p>Karma Rescue saves at-risk dogs from the high-kill Los Angeles area shelters. Karma provides each dog a new beginning and finds them safe and suitable permanent homes through adoption, advocacy and education. Karma Rescue is a non-profit 501c3, tax deductible organization.</p>

	<p>We run COMPLETELY off charitable contributions. We want to thank all of those who have been contributing to our cause, and wish everyone good Karma.</p>
